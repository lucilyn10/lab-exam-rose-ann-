            <p> Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, an extraordinary Indian scientist and the 11th President of India (2002-2007), left an indelible mark on our nation. Born on October 15, 1931, he was affectionately known as The Missile Man for his pivotal role in developing missile and nuclear weapon projects. Let’s pay homage to this remarkable leader.Dr. Kalam was born into a Tamil Muslim family in Rameswaram, a pilgrimage center on Pamban Island in what was then the Madras Presidency (now Tamil Nadu).
                He graduated in physics from Saint Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli, affiliated with the University of Madras.
                His passion for aerospace engineering led him to pursue studies at the Madras Institute of Technology.
